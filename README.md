### Effectiveness of Commodity Futures in Curbing Spot Volatility

This study examines the impact of introduction of futures trading on the spot price volatility in the commodity market. The paper considers the United States of America, South Africa and Ethiopian economies. Three commodities i.e. coffee, maize and wheat from New York Mercantile Exchange, South African Futures Exchange and Ethiopian Commodity Exchange are analyzed. ARCH LM test is used to check for heteroskedasticity and GARCH and EGARCH are used to check for the behavior of volatility for the pre- and post-futures periods. For all the three economies, the results indicate presence of the ARCH effect in the log returns. For conditional and unconditional variances; spot price volatility for coffee has decreased after futures trading across all the economies and the EGARCH has also shown reduction in persistence of volatility in the post-futures period in the three economies; while that of maize has reduced for the Ethiopian economy but increased in both the US and South African economies. For wheat, the conditional variance has been found to rise in the post-futures period in all the three economies. These results imply that more positive feedback from futures trading is bound to be seen for maize in the less developed economies as opposed to the developed economies as opposed to the other products. This paper has focused on the overlooked factor by earlier researchers, i.e. of economic-gap amongst countries, in looking at the impact of the futures trading on the spot price variation.

### Currency Portfolio Optimization With an Innovative Covariance Matrix Estimator (qmle)

With the advent of high frequency data, the sum of squared returns between trades which is the most common estimator, is biased by microstructure effects like bid-ask bounce thus the need to drop most of the data. Nonetheless, a number of alternative estimators that make efficient use of the available data have been developed. However, choosing an estimator is not trivial since the study of their relative merits focuses on the speed of convergence to their asymptotic distributions. This in itself is not necessarily a reliable guide to finite sample performance, especially for cases when there is violation of assumptions on the price or noise process. Nonetheless, the covariation between asset returns plays a crucial role in modern finance in portfolio optimization, risk management and asset pricing. The paper is an effort towards estimating a covariance matrix using high-frequency data (quadratic covariation) from the portfolio selection perspective. Besides the significant increase in the sample size for estimation of the covariance matrix, use of HFD also enables for better adaptation to the local volatilities and correlations amongst a vast number of assets. This thus leads to an an improved estimation of portfolio variance. 1-minute, 5-minute, 30-minute and daily sampled forex data were used across the six major world currencies; i.e. EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD and EUR/CAD. Covariancematrices based on intraday returns were constructed and evaluated.

### Weather Shocks and Commodity Spot Prices

The study was conducted across three agricultural commodities, namely; corn, cotton and wheat against a number of weather variables, including; temperature, rainfall, precipitation, sea level pressure, snow, fog and hail. This is after dropping a number of weather variables that are highly correlated from the correlation matrix. The results indicate significance of these exogenous variables in explaining the price variations as seen from the p-values of 0.00 across the three commodities. The SARIMAX prediction also did well for Corn and Cotton prices as seen by the sufficiently high r2 score as opposed to the estimate gotten from wheat. (Yet to study the same applying AI techniques).

### Crude Oil Price Modeling

Energy remains an essential pillar for human livelihood for its necessity in sustainability and development of any current civilization. One of the main feature distinguishing it from most of the other commodities is the mean-reverting characteristic together with evident spikes and high volatility as seen for electricity and crude oil prices. Here, we’ll look at crude oil daily spot prices. A number of works have employed the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to model directly the dynamics over time of different commodity spot prices under reduced-form one-factor models (Ribeiro and Hodges, 2004). Nonetheless, in recent studies, crude oil spot price has also been modelled as a jump-diffusion process, as attributed to Merton (1976), as in Jorion (1988) for asset returns and Ball & Torous (1983) for foreign exchange and other securities. Moreover, due to the presence of skewness and fat tails in the empirical distribution of oil price returns, the series is more effectively modeled using Levy models which assign higher probabilities to sudden unexpected events unlike the gaussian models like Black Scholes model. These jump-diffusion models incorporate jumps into a diffusion process through a Poisson process with parameter, λ.

### Carbon Emission Modeling

Energy remains an essential pillar for human livelihood for its necessity in sustainability and development of any current civilization. One of the main feature distinguishing it from most of the other commodities is the mean-reverting characteristic together with evident spikes and high volatility as seen for electricity prices. Here, we’ll look at carbon emission in Kenya. A number of works have employed the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to model directly the dynamics over time of different commodity spot prices under reduced-form one-factor models (Ribeiro and Hodges, 2004). Here, we derive the analytical solution to the stochastic differential equation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: dXt=κ(θ−Xt)dt+σdWt where the Wt is a standard wiener process, and κ>0, θ and σ>0 Motivated by the observation that θ is supposed to be the long-term mean of the process Xt, we can simplify the above SDE by introducing the change of variable; Yt=Xt−θ that subtracts off the mean. The Yt satisfies the SDE; dYt=dXt=−κYtdt+σdWt for this SDE, the process Yt is seen to have a drift towards zero value, at an exponential rate κ. This motivates the change of variables; Yt=e−κtZt ⇔ Zt=eκtYt , which should remove the drift. The O-U process does a pretty good work on our dataset.

### Credit Scoring Model with AI

The goal of this project was to build a model that lenders can use to help make the best financial decisions regarding the customers to lend and those not to lend. Therefore, the main goal is to build a state-of-the-art credit scoring model by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years. This is a binary classification problem with classes; 0 : Not deliquent & 1: Deliquency (Kaggle Challenge). The study took into consideration four main classifiers including; Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees and k-Nearest Neighbours.
